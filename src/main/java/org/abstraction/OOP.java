/**
 * OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
 * Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data,
 * while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.
 * Two main aspects of OOP are Classes and Objects. In OOP, everything is associated with classes and objects.
 *
 * Advantages:
 *   - faster and easier to execute
 *   - provides clear structure for the programs
 *   - code is easier to maintain, modify and debug
 *   - helps to keep Java code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) - reduces repetition of code
 *
 * Basic OOP terminology:
 *   - Class    - is a template (blueprint) for creating objects, that contains variables and methods (function)
 *   - Object   - is an instance of a class, that works with variables and run methods
 *   - Class variables  - data variables (or attributes) that can be used when object is created from a class
 *   - Class methods    - functions that can be executed when object is created from a class
 *   - Method parameter - parameter that is passed to a method (can be int, String, or whatever else)
 *   - Method variable  - variable that is available only within a method. That's why multiple variables with identical name can be available in a single class
 *   - "this" keyword   - keyword this refers to the current object in a method or constructor
 *   - Constructor      - method that is called as soon as object of a class is created. Always has a name identical to name of class
 *
 * In this example, we create an class OOP that is a template for creating objects, and implement some methods and constructors.
 * and in another class (@see class {@link OOPExample}, we will create objects of this class, and demonstrate their usage
